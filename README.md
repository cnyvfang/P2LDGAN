# P2LDGAN
- This repository is the code for "Learning to Generate Artistic Character Line Drawing". [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02998)

# News!
- Fortunately this article was accepted by ACM ICMR2023 and the Camera-ready version will be released soon.
- I am in the process of clean useless code for this project and finalising the publicly available parts of the dataset. These will be made public here in the next few months.(I am sorry that this process may not be particularly quick, as I have been busy with various competitions and looking for internships recently.)

## Pre-trained Models
You can download our pre-trained models which using P2LDGAN with our constructed line-drawing dataset via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1To4V_Btc3QhCLBWZ0PdSNgC1cbm3isHP/view?usp=sharing)

## Sample Results
(a) Input photo/image; (b) Ground truth; (c) Gatys; (d) CycleGAN; (e) DiscoGAN; (f) UNIT; (g) pix2pix; (h) MUNIT; (i) Our baseline; (j) Our P2LDGAN.
